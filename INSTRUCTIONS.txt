This tool is meant to slow down the signal processing abillity of a device and buy my team some extra time.
The tool uses an ICMP ping flood to jam up network traffic on a target IP.
Enter the number of threads you would like to run at a time (each thread has 4 ICMP requests)
Then enter the target IP by each of its octets and it will fire immediatley.
While it may be tempting to immediatly fire an absurd amount packets, teams then have to deal with this immedeatly.
By constantly sending out moderate ammounts of traffic, you slow the network down without becoming the main focus.
Then if you need a big distraction, you can turn the traffic up.
